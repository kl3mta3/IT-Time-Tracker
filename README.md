csharpCopypublic class Record : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private string _reference;
    public string Reference
    {
        get => _reference;
        set
        {
            if (_reference != value)
            {
                _reference = value;
                OnPropertyChanged(nameof(Reference));
            }
        }
    }

    // Other properties (TimeSpent, Date) follow the same pattern

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    protected virtual void OnPropertyChanged(string propertyName)
    {
        PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
    }
}
